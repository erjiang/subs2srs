subs2srs with mods
==================

I'm working on getting this to run on Linux. So far the basic features work, but Preview doesn't yet for unknown reasons.

To run on Linux, you will need to:

* Install Mono
* Install "Microsoft Sans Serif" font
* Install ffmpeg and make sure it's in your PATH

Version
-------
Currently this is based off of v29.6 from Sourceforge, which is the latest version as of December 2016.
